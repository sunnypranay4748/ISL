# Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university. We don't really want R to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands:
rownames(school)=school[,1]
fix(school)
head(school)

rownames(school) = school[, 1]
head(school)

school= school[, -1]
head(school)

# Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.

# Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[, 1:10].
